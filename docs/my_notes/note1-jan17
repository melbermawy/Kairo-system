Here's where I save some of my chatgpt responses so that I don't forget them.

What’s still NOT locked (and blocks spec TOC v2)

To write the real spec/PRD outline without hand-waving, we still need to lock:
	1.	Opportunity card v1 fields (must-have vs nice-to-have, all evidence optional)
	2.	Freshness model (per platform) + how we compute/display it
	3.	Opportunity scoring language (even if simple v1)
	4.	Source activation: how Apify inputs are built deterministically (what signals, what queries, what caps/limits)
	5.	Page flow: Today → Opportunity detail → Concept builder page (you dislike drawers; so page-based)
	6.	Persistence rules: concept belongs to brand+opportunity; allow multiple concepts per opportunity


-----------------------


Yep. You’re steering this correctly. Here’s the crisp clarification + the decision frame on “reuse vs ditch”.

1) Correction: I mixed two pipelines. You’re right.

When we talk source strategy / source activation for opportunities, the inputs are:
	•	Brand context (from BrandBrain snapshot + brand config)
	•	Platform scope (what sources are connected / enabled)
	•	Opportunity types we want (trend / competitor / news / community)
	•	Budget + freshness constraints

Not “concept intent”. Concept intent starts after an opportunity exists and the user clicks Build Concept. That’s downstream.

So: Opportunities pipeline = external world scan → candidate signals → score/filter → opportunity cards.
Concept pipeline = opportunity + user inputs → concept object.

2) Frontend prototype: keep visuals, throw away contracts

Agree. The UI repo is a design reference, not a source of truth. We can reuse:
	•	card layout patterns
	•	interaction patterns (expand, detail view, CTA placement)
	•	visual hierarchy

We should NOT reuse:
	•	any DTO assumptions
	•	identifiers
	•	evidence shape guesses
	•	lifecycle fields unless we can actually produce them

Backend owns reality.

3) Performance stance (and your reminder)

Also agree: “design for long work” is not a license for slow engineering.
We do both:
	•	Backend best practices (caps, caching, incrementalization, deterministic idempotency, bounded LLM calls)
	•	UI states for unavoidable work (first run, regeneration, cache miss)

And yes: same pattern should be applied to BrandBrain compile UI later.

4) The big fork: ditch the existing opportunities engine or refactor it?

Given the Phase 0 backend world model you pasted, we should reuse and refactor, not ditch.

Why reuse (hard reasons, not vibes)

The backend already has valuable primitives that are expensive to rebuild correctly:
	•	persistence model + indexes
	•	deterministic ids + update_or_create idempotency
	•	scoring rubric + validation gates
	•	dedupe
	•	degraded mode fallback
	•	DTO separation (DraftDTO vs DTO vs TodayBoardDTO)
	•	engine/graph structure you can extend

Throwing that away is how you regress into “AI slop hell” again.

What we do ditch

We ditch the product assumptions baked into it:
	•	channel validation hardcoded to {linkedin, x} (that’s misaligned with your IG/TikTok-first strategy)
	•	empty external signals bundle (must be wired)
	•	any cringe B2B-ish prompting / output style
	•	any DTO fields that are artifacts of the old vision

So the correct posture is:

Keep the skeleton. Replace the brain.

Meaning: keep orchestration + storage + guardrails, replace:
	•	external signal sourcing
	•	prompt strategy
	•	channel/type constraints
	•	evidence tracking layer
	•	freshness + cost policy

5) Answer your last question directly

are we completely ditching that? or recycle/reuse/refactor?

Recycle + refactor the backend engine.
Replace its source strategy and contracts.
Discard LinkedIn-centric assumptions.
Then re-connect frontend using a strict contract authority.

6) Where we go next (since you chose source activation first)

Next topic = Source activation strategy for opportunities.

To make that discussion concrete (and avoid hand-waving), we need to lock three things:
	1.	What sources exist at v1 (IG reels is core; what else is allowed)
	2.	What “query inputs” each source needs (what does Apify need to run)
	3.	What the minimal normalized evidence item is (so every source maps into one common shape)

If you paste the Apify actor sample outputs (IG reels scraper first), we can do this without guessing and without wasting credits.
