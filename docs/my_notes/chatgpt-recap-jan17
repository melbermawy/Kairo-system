Kairo — Canonical Continuity & Pre-Spec Context Document

Purpose of this document

This document exists as a continuity anchor. Its sole goal is to allow a fresh ChatGPT session (or any collaborator) to fully reconstruct the mental model, vision, constraints, decisions, and engineering reality of the Kairo project without relying on chat history.

It is intentionally long, explicit, and redundant where needed. This is not a spec, not a PRD, and not an implementation guide. It is the ground truth context that must be understood before writing specs.

⸻

1. What Kairo Is (and Is Not)

1.1 What Kairo Is

Kairo is an AI-native content intelligence system designed to help brands:
	1.	Understand their positioning and constraints (via BrandBrain)
	2.	Continuously scan the external world for content opportunities
	3.	Help humans convert those opportunities into clear content concepts
	4.	Generate content packages (hooks, beats, snippets, direction) — not documents

Kairo is not a social media scheduler, not a doc editor, and not a generic “AI copywriter.” Its value is upstream clarity and leverage, not downstream execution.

At a high level, Kairo is a loop, not a single action:

BrandBrain → Opportunities → Concept Builder → Content Packages → Learning → (feeds back)

Each stage has strict boundaries, ownership, and contracts.

⸻

1.2 What Kairo Is Not

Kairo is explicitly not:
	•	A WYSIWYG editor
	•	A Google Docs replacement
	•	A scheduling / posting tool
	•	A prompt playground
	•	A monolithic AI agent that “does everything”

Humans remain responsible for:
	•	final wording
	•	creative judgment
	•	distribution

Kairo provides structure, insight, and leverage, not replacement.

⸻

2. The Core Loop (Correct Mental Model)

This loop distinction is critical and was clarified multiple times to avoid conceptual bugs.

2.1 BrandBrain (Upstream Authority)

BrandBrain is the authoritative internal representation of a brand.

It includes (at minimum):
	•	positioning
	•	audience intent
	•	tone / voice constraints
	•	taboos
	•	pillars
	•	personas
	•	competitive landscape (when available)

BrandBrain:
	•	is compiled (slow, heavy, explicit UI feedback)
	•	is the source of truth for all downstream logic
	•	does not depend on opportunities or concepts

BrandBrain output is consumed by:
	•	Opportunity engine (to know what to look for)
	•	Concept builder (to know what’s allowed)
	•	Content packaging (to know how to phrase things)

⸻

2.2 Opportunities (External World Scan)

Opportunities answer the question:

“Given who this brand is, what external situations are worth making content about right now?”

Key properties:
	•	An opportunity is not a post
	•	An opportunity is not a hook
	•	An opportunity is not a concept

An opportunity represents:
	•	a trend
	•	a competitor move or gap
	•	a news moment
	•	a community signal

Opportunities are candidate situations that could justify content.

⸻

2.3 Concept Builder (Human Intent Layer)

The Concept Builder is where the human intervenes.

It answers:

“Given this opportunity, what do I want to say and how do I want to say it?”

It is:
	•	structured
	•	opinionated
	•	tiered (minimal required vs optional enrichment)

Concept Builder outputs a Concept Object that is later consumed by the content engine.

⸻

2.4 Content Packages (Downstream Output)

Content Packages:
	•	are not documents
	•	are not scripts
	•	are not final copy

They include:
	•	multiple hooks (variants)
	•	beats / narrative structure
	•	proof points
	•	CTAs
	•	pre-production direction

Everything is copy-pasteable and meant to accelerate human writing elsewhere.

⸻

3. What Is Already Implemented (Reality Check)

A critical realization in this project was that we already have a real backend, not a toy.

3.1 Existing Backend: Opportunities Phase 0

There is a fully implemented Opportunities engine with:
	•	API endpoints (/today, /regenerate)
	•	persistence models
	•	deterministic IDs
	•	deduplication
	•	scoring
	•	degraded mode fallback
	•	DTO separation (Draft → DTO → Board)
	•	LLM graphs

However:
	•	it is LinkedIn-centric
	•	it assumes outdated channel logic
	•	external signals are stubbed
	•	BrandBrain did not exist at the time

The correct decision (locked):

Reuse the skeleton. Replace the brain.

We explicitly do not throw this away.

⸻

3.2 What We Keep

We keep:
	•	orchestration
	•	persistence
	•	idempotency
	•	DTO separation
	•	dedupe
	•	degraded mode
	•	observability hooks

These are expensive to rebuild correctly and already exist.

⸻

3.3 What We Replace

We replace:
	•	source strategy
	•	external signal wiring
	•	channel assumptions
	•	scoring semantics (but not the mechanism)
	•	opportunity meaning
	•	DTO contracts (vNext)

This is a refactor, not a rewrite.

⸻

4. Frontend: What It Is and Is Not

The existing frontend (Today page) exists primarily as a visual exploration.

4.1 What Frontend Is Used For
	•	understanding card layout
	•	understanding UX flow
	•	visualizing end-state
	•	discovering product nuance

4.2 What Frontend Is Not
	•	a source of truth
	•	a schema authority
	•	a contract reference

All frontend contracts must be driven by backend DTOs.

Current frontend data is fake / placeholder.

⸻

5. Performance & UX Philosophy

Two principles coexist:
	1.	Good engineering (don’t be slow because you’re sloppy)
	2.	Honest UX (some work is inherently slow)

5.1 Backend Principles
	•	bounded LLM calls
	•	deterministic input builders
	•	caching where appropriate
	•	strict caps
	•	idempotency

5.2 Frontend Principles
	•	explicit loading states
	•	no “frozen UI”
	•	communicate what’s happening

This applies to:
	•	Today board generation
	•	BrandBrain compilation

⸻

6. Opportunity Feature — Vision (Locked)

6.1 Opportunity Definition (Locked)

An opportunity is:

A brand-relevant external signal that justifies creating content at this time.

It is not a post. It is not a script. It is not a hook.

⸻

6.2 Opportunity Types (V1 Locked)
	•	Trend
	•	Competitor
	•	News
	•	Community signal

No more, no less.

⸻

6.3 Evidence
	•	Minimum: 1 evidence item
	•	Evidence can be heterogeneous
	•	Evidence shape must be normalized

We do not over-optimize this pre-spec.

⸻

7. Source Strategy (Deeply Discussed)

7.1 Two-Stage Source Activation (Locked)

Stage 1: Discovery / Search
	•	broad scanning
	•	hashtags
	•	search queries
	•	competitors

Stage 2: Deep Extraction
	•	post URLs
	•	transcripts
	•	rich metadata

Stage 2 is expensive and selective.

⸻

7.2 Instagram Strategy (Key Nuance)
	•	Instagram Reels Scraper is rich but requires known targets
	•	Instagram Scraper supports search / hashtags / discovery

Correct strategy:
	•	use Instagram Scraper for discovery
	•	feed URLs into Reels Scraper for deep extraction

⸻

7.3 TikTok Strategy
	•	TikTok surfaces trends earlier
	•	hashtag search is powerful
	•	used to enrich confidence and freshness

TikTok is complementary, not identical to IG.

⸻

7.4 Seed Terms

Seed terms come from:
	•	BrandBrain (structured + unstructured)
	•	high-volume generic hashtags (#fyp, #viral, etc.)
	•	niche tags derived from brand context

This requires a pipeline, not hardcoding.

⸻

7.5 Budget & Caps
	•	caps are enforced
	•	recency windows are enforced
	•	credits are spent intentionally

Exact numbers are spec-level decisions.

⸻

8. Concept Builder — Vision (Locked)

8.1 Purpose

Concept Builder bridges:

Opportunity → Human Intent → Machine-usable Concept


⸻

8.2 Tiered Inputs

Tier 1 (Required):
	•	What’s your take?
	•	Format (grouped platforms)
	•	Target audience (human-readable)

Tier 2 (Optional):
	•	Proof points
	•	CTA
	•	Constraints

Tiering reduces friction.

⸻

8.3 Target Audience (Resolved Philosophy)

Audience labels are:
	•	human
	•	casual
	•	non-marketing-jargon

Examples:
	•	existing followers
	•	general audience
	•	customers
	•	peers
	•	community

No funnel-stage jargon.

⸻

9. DeepAgents & LLM Graphs (Clarified)

9.1 What DeepAgents Are
	•	bounded reasoning units
	•	used inside pipelines
	•	deterministic inputs
	•	deterministic outputs

9.2 What They Are Not
	•	not DTO authors
	•	not product decision makers
	•	not free-form copilots

They serve the system, not the other way around.

⸻

9.3 Graph Philosophy

Graphs:
	•	have strict nodes
	•	strict contracts
	•	strict validation

LLMs are tools, not arbiters of truth.

⸻

10. Spec Philosophy (Important)

We explicitly separated:
	•	Vision locking (this document)
	•	Spec writing (next phase)

Spec writing will:
	•	define DTO vNext
	•	define scoring language
	•	define freshness logic
	•	wire sources

But it must be anchored in everything above.

⸻

11. Purpose of the Chat

This chat existed to:
	•	surface hidden mismatches
	•	correct mental models
	•	align on boundaries
	•	prevent bad specs

The result is not code — it is clarity.

⸻

12. How to Use This Document

When starting a new chat:
	1.	Paste this document
	2.	Ask the model to read it carefully
	3.	Only then resume work

If the model misunderstands fundamentals after reading this, it is not usable.
