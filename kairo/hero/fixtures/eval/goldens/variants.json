It's ruthless consolidation around your core data flows.\n\n3 questions to start:\n1. Which 3 tools actually touch revenue data?\n2. What's your single source of truth for pipeline?\n3. Who owns data quality (not 'everyone')?\n\nIf you can't answer these clearly, you have a strategy problem, not a tooling problem.\n\nWhat's your experience? Drop a comment.",

Unclear ownership - PRs assigned to 'the team' mean nobody reviews them\n2. No response time expectations - is 4 hours fast or slow?\n3. Review depth varies wildly - some get 50 comments, others get LGTM\n\nThe fix is cultural, not technical:\n\n- Assign primary reviewers explicitly\n- Set response time SLAs (we use 4 business hours)\n- Define what 'good enough' review looks like\n\nWhat's blocking your PRs?",
